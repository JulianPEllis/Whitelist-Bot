# Whitelist Bot

A very simple discord server whitelist bot using Python 3.6.6!


# How to use

Simply add the whitelist names to the array, then restart the bot!! Anyone that tries to join the server without being on the list, will be kicked! In order to disable, simply run the command `-toggle`


# Notice

If you restart the bot, the toggle setting will be set to whatever it is in the code.

- False = Off
- True = On
